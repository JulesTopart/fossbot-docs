## What is FOSSBot?

FOSSBot is a small, customizable robot that helps people learn about technology, coding, engineering and many more topics. It’s designed to be easy to build and program, so anyone can start experimenting with robotics, even if they have no prior experience. As the project is still under active development, some features may not be 100% functional.

### How does it work?

At the heart of FOSSBot is its “brain” — a tiny computer called a Raspberry Pi Zero. This is where all the robot’s decisions are made, whether it’s moving forward, turning, or following instructions programmed by you. 

The robot senses the world around it using sensors like a distance sensors, light sensors...

You can control FOSSBot in different ways:

- **No-code mode** for complete beginners (using Blockly)
- **Block-based programming** (where you drag and drop instructions)
- **Python coding** for more advanced users

## What can you do with FOSSBot?

With FOSSBot, you can:

- Program the robot to draw pictures using its built-in pencil holder
- Explore coding by creating simple or complex tasks for it to perform
- Learn how different sensors work and how robots navigate their environment

FOSSBot is perfect for schools, coding workshops, or even at home as a fun project.

### Key Features

- **Affordable and customizable**: FOSSBot is made from 3D-printed parts and low-cost electronics, so it’s easy to build and fix. You can print the robot's body yourself and adjust it to your liking.
- **Durable and flexible**: The robot’s plastic parts are strong and designed to protect its wheels and sensors.
- **LEGO-compatible**: You can add LEGO bricks to the robot, making it even more fun to customize and expand.
- **Learning-friendly**: FOSSBot supports no-coding, block-based coding, and full Python programming, making it suitable for all skill levels.

### How it’s built

The robot is made up of:

- **3D-printed plastic parts**: You can download the designs and print them yourself, using strong materials that keep everything secure.
- **Electronic components**: The robot uses motors for the wheels, sensors for detecting movement, and an LED for visual feedback.
- **Raspberry Pi computer**: This is the robot’s “brain” where all the thinking happens. It runs a special operating system and software that lets you control and program the robot.

### Ready to get started?
