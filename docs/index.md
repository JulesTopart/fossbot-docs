## What is FOSSBot?

FOSSBot is a DIY robot designed for educational purposes. It comes with a complete hardware and software stack that includes:

- **Raspberry Pi Zero** for control and connectivity
- **3D-printable parts** made from durable PETG filament
- **Sensors** such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and odometers
- **Custom features** like a pencil holder for drawing and a LEGO-compatible top cover

The FOSSBot platform provides different programming modes:
- No-coding mode for beginners
- Block-based coding using Google Blockly
- Python programming for advanced users

FOSSBot promotes hands-on learning, making it perfect for classrooms, coding workshops, or at-home experimentation. The robot can be assembled for under $200 and encourages contributions from the open-source community.

## Key Features
- Affordable and customizable with low-cost electronics
- Repairable and modular, thanks to 3D-printed parts
- Full software stack supporting microservices and Python
- Web-based programming tools and a simulator for testing programs
